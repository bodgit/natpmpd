.Sh NAME
.Nm natpmpd
.Nd NAT-PMP & PCP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm natpmpd
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon which implements both the NAT-PMP and PCP protocols.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/natpmpd.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
To allow
.Nm
to create mappings,
.Xr pf.conf 5
needs the following rule.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
anchor "natpmpd"
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Pa /etc/natpmpd.conf

.Sh CAVEATS
.Xr pf 4
does not allow the ruleset to be modified if the system is running at a
.Xr securelevel 7
higher than 1.
At that level
.Nm
cannot add rules to the anchors and neither NAT-PMP nor PCP requests will work.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Matt Dainty Aq matt@bodgit-n-scarper.com .
.Sh BUGS
IPv6 PCP support is currently unimplemented although
.Nm
will correctly reject such requests.
.Pp
Support for the PCP PEER opcode is unimplemented as well as any PCP MAP opcode
which attempts to map anything other than individual TCP or UDP ports.
